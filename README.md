### Issues ###

Due to this being my first medium-sized project, I was not aware of the importance of app architecture.

Because of this, the code follows a pattern of View -> logic_[item].py -> Model, where logic_[item].py is a file containing functions which do the heavy lifting. When I find some free time, I would like to fix this.
