- Add forgot password option

- Add drop assignment funcitonality

When changing categories, do not recalculate the ENTIRE grades. Instead, find the new course.weights (find all additions and subtractions in course titles/num_assignments) first. Then, use the old weights in conjunction with the new weights, looping through the changed items as follows:

for student in students:
    for changed in changed_items:
        student.grade -= assignment_grade * old.weight / old.num
        student.grade += assignment_grade * new.weight / new.num
